	<h1>NY families still recovering from 2008 recession face economic uncertainty</h1>
    <h2>By Elizabeth Turley | May 4, 2020</h2>
    <hr>

<p>The Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 until June 2009, was a period of great economic uncertainty for people all around the world. In New York, many people lost their jobs and even their homes, eventually turning to the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in order to feed their families.</p>

<p>SNAP is a national program that allocates resources (formerly referred to as “food stamps”) to eligible people and families with economic insecurity, allowing them to purchase specific food items that are deemed necessary. In New York, these criteria are determined by the Office of Temporary and Disability Services (OTDA). In order to apply, families and individuals must meet income thresholds and create a SNAP budget. The application is available to New Yorkers both online and at local departments of social services.</p>

<p>In January of 2008, the OTDA removed restrictions on SNAP eligibility, making it possible for applicants with savings, checking or retirement accounts to apply for benefits. The percentage of New Yorkers receiving benefits immediately shot up and has only just begun to decrease over the last four years. </p>

	<br>
	<p>However, since Governor Andrew Cuomo placed New York on “PAUSE” protocol due to COVID-19, many New Yorkers have once again lost their source of income. In light of this emergency, the state OTDA issued an emergency benefit for March and April of 2020, which gave a supplemental SNAP allowance to all families not already receiving the maximum allotment for their household. So far the office has not issued a statement relating whether these emergency benefits will extend to May 2020.</p>

        <p>
      According to the New York OTDA’s website, “Households CAN use SNAP benefits to buy foods for the household to eat, such as, but not limited to, breads and cereals, fruits and vegetables, meats, fish and poultry, dairy products, and seeds and plants which produce food for the household to eat. Households CANNOT use SNAP benefits to buy beer, wine, liquor, cigarettes or tobacco, food that will be eaten in the store, hot foods, or any nonfood items.” The impact of the coronavirus means it is likely that the number of New Yorkers relying on government benefits to feed their households will go up before the state sees any continuation to this trend of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
